Introduction
Looking for a simple API to read and write AFP files? E.g. to inject NOP
records? Then consider this project.

This software has already been used to process hundreds of millions of
pages.

I have witnessed many cases whereby highly complex software was used
for relatively simple operations on IBM AFP data stream files. Although
the implementation of an IBM AFP library in theory is straight forward,
no such thing is currently was available or was actively maintained when
this project started.

This library provides a framework for parsing and generating IBM AFP data
stream files. It's current state is "good enough for simple operations".

The library can dump AFP records as text files. Already implemented records
have are clearly described. Not yet implemented records are simple byte
dumps.
Also supported is a dump of MD5 sums of records which allows the comparison
of AFP data streams.

A record grouper allows grouping of AFP records.

Main design features:
- Support for generic AFP classes for not yet implemented AFP data structures.
- Support for specific AFP classes.
- Support for dumping to text file.
- Support for dumping of MD5 sums of IBM structures to text file.

Contributions
Should you decide to contribute then please note the following:
- This is a GPL project. If you contribute you should also license your
  work as such. See the COPYING file.
Code style:
- Let Eclipse always format your code.
- Sort the members using the Eclipse standard feature.
- Avoid letting attributes depend on the order they are declared.
