Introduction
In the past years I have witnessed many cases whereby highly complex
software was used for relatively simple operations on IBM AFP data stream
files. Although the implementation of an IBM AFP library in theory is
straight forward, no such thing is currently available and is being
actively developed.

This library provides a framework for parsing and generating IBM AFP data
stream files. It's current state is "good enough for simple operations".

The library can dump AFP records as text files. Already implemented records
have are clearly described. Not yet implemented records are simple byte
dumps.
Also supported is a dump of MD5 sums of records which allows the comparison
of AFP data streams.

A record grouper allows grouping of AFP records.

Main design features:
- Support for generic AFP classes for not yet implemented AFP data structures.
- Support for specific AFP classes.
- Support for dumping to text file.
- Support for dumping of MD5 sums of IBM structures to text file.
